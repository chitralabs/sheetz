```java
// Example of how the feature might look
List<Product> products = Sheetz.read("data.ods", Product.class); // ODS support
```

## Alternatives Considered
Have you tried any workarounds? What other libraries/tools handle this?

- [ ] I can help test it
- [ ] I just need the feature

## Additional Context
